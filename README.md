In blackjack, players attempt to reach a score of 21—without exceeding it—before the dealer hits 17. You can win if you don’t bust and your total is higher than the dealer cards. Hitting exactly 21 can mean even bigger winnings.

One ace and one 10 card or jack card automatically mean 21, so remember that going into the game. Watch for more information and tips, plus when to hit, split, hold and fold.
